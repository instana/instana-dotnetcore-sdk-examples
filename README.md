# Instana SDK Examples for .NET Core

This repository provides examples on how to use the Instana Tracing SDK for .NET Core, starting with .NET Core 2.1.
The Instana SDK is provided by the [Instana.Tracing.Core.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Instana.Tracing.Core.Sdk/) Nuget package, which you need to add to the applications in which you want to use the SDK alongside the [rest of the Instana instrumentation](https://www.instana.com/docs/ecosystem/dot-net-core#tracing).

Once the `Instana.Tracing.Core.Sdk` package is installed, you can use the APIs it provides to create your own traces, spans and tags that will be added to those generated by the Instana automatic instrumentation.
For more information on the tracing model of Instana, refer to the [Concepts of tracing](https://www.instana.com/docs/tracing/concepts) documentation.

## Capabilities

The SDK lets you create spans, which compose a trace, that will be ultimately available on your Instana unit. To create those spans and transport meaningful data, it exposes the following capabilities

* create spans for `EXIT`, `ENTRY` and `INTERMEDIATE`
* add tags to every span
* add data to every span
* add a result to a span
* add an exception to a span

## Setup

Please refer to the [Installing the SDK](https://docs.instana.io/ecosystem/dot-net/tracing-sdk/#installing-the-sdk) documentation to add the SDK Nuget package to your application.

You only have to add the nuget-package to your project and add the code to create the spans.
This usually follows the following pattern:

```C#
private void MyMethod()
{
    using(var span = CustomSpan.Create(...))
    {
        // your original method's code
    }
}
```

The APIs on `CustomSpan` expose several overloads, according to what you want to achieve.

**Note:** To see in Instana the additional spans and tags you create via the SDK, you need an Instana host agent running on the host where your application runs.
